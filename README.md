## Issues when running
Github CSP rules do not allow for websocket connections on localhost. Use
[this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/always-disable-content-se/ffelghdomoehpceihalcnbmnodohkibj)
to get over these rules. Don't forget to uninstall it after.

## Why use websockets?
Storing all frames in javascript was a little slow. Tried RLE, but they were still
too big/too many.

The server was easy and fast alternative for streaming the frames.
